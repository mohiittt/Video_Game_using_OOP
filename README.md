# Video_Game_using_OOP

 You're going to use what you've learned about OOP (on Day 64) to store characters for my video game.

1. My game needs to have a character with a name, health and magic points.
2. It needs these values setup when it is initialized.
3. It needs a method to output this data.
4. There should be a sub-class 'player' which inherits from character and also has a number of lives.
5. Player should also have an 'am I alive?' method which checks the player status and reports back yes or no.
6. There should also be an 'enemy' sub-class with additional 'type' and 'strength'.
7. 'enemy' should have two sub-classes:
8. 'orc' with a 'speed' attribute.
9. 'vampire' with a 'day/night' tracker
10. Instantiate one player, two vampires and three orcs. You choose their names.
11. Print out their values.
